# DSLP
## Data structure for language professionals

### Modules

* Module 1: [*Encoding*](DSLP_M01.ipynb) (purpose, detection, decoding)
* Module 2: [*Document structure, parsing & validation*](DSLP_M02.ipynb) (XML as an example)
* Module 3: [*Populating & layout*](DSLP_M03.ipynb) (very simple HTML & CSS)
* Module 4: [*Pattern matching*](DSLP_M04.ipynb) (Ctrl-F on steroids)
* Module 5: [*Batch replacements*](DSLP_M05.ipynb) (search and ~destroy~ replace *en masse*)
* Module 6: [*Pipelining*](DSLP_M01.py) (click the pieces together in an environment you manage)
* Module 7: [*Case-study selection*](#Case-study-selection) (pick a project topic)
* Modules 8 to 13: [*Final project*](#Final-project) (plan / carry out / evaluate and present the project)

#### Case-study selection

In picking your case study, please ensure your chosen case study contains **at least one element from each** of the three buckets below and a **minimum of seven elements in total** across all three buckets: 

* *Content* bucket (5 options): dates / units / colors / images / orientation.
* *Goal* bucket (4 options): template population / layout depends on content / something is localized / something is translated.
* *Tech* bucket (6 options): encoding / parsing / regular expressions / file reading / file writing / directory listing.

#### Final project

Develop the project at your own pace within the allocated time frame, but be sure to make a plan (instead of putting it all off until the night before the deadline). It is recommended to submit 
1. the *plan* to obtain feedback on it prior to starting the development;
2. the *source code* (a Github or a Colab link or a ZIP of the necessary files) to obtain feedback on it prior to presenting;
3. the *documentation* of the project in writing prior to the date of the presentation, in case something unexpected occurs the day of.
